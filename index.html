 <h2>WEB</h2> 
 <p>Web and CWEB are certainly distinct subjects. However, both articles are very brief and they're very closely related with enough overlap that everyone—Wikipedia editors and readers alike—would probably benefit if both articles were merged into one. Logically, it would make sense that Web be the main article, and CWEB be a "chapter" within, and we can set things up so that people searching for CWEB or visiting the CWEB article are redirected straight there. On the other hand, "Web" is a bit ambiguous, and it might be argued that CWEB is the most notable of the two, in which case we could frame "Web" and its history as essential background info for CWEB, and where our encyclopedia entry lives in an article under the CWEB name. -- C.
